persona: Service owner
phase:  Service development

Documentation should be easily accessible a kept in one central location. It should be kept up-to-date and easy to understand. Documentation should be split into admin and user documentation.

User-facing documentation should contain information on how to use the service. It should have information on how to access the service and configure it. It should also include the complete list of features available to the user. Documentation should have links to the support process, privacy policy, RBAC policy, terms and conditions, and SLAs.

Admin-facing documentation should contain information on setting up the development environment and contributing. It should have defined troubleshooting methods that can be used to resolve simple problems. Admin documentation also describes how to interact with a user.

It is also important to follow [general guidelines](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/index.html) of writing good documentation

## Requirements

General:
- Documentation should be easy to find and understand
- It should be kept up-to-date with new a releases
- It should be defined in a central location


User-facing documentation should contain:
- Process how to access the service
- Steps how to get started - basic use case of the service
- Ways to configure service with example configuration
- Link to the support process
- Links to the privacy policy, RBAC policy terms and conditions, SLAs
- Complete list of features available to users

Admin facing documentation should contain:
- Development documentation - information on how to set up the development environment and how to contribute to service
- Basic troubleshooting knowledge that operators of the service can use
- How to interact with the users - support process from the view of the administrator

## Reasoning

Documentation allows users to adopt service faster and start using it efficiently. It also gives administrators procedures they can follow in case of problems, leading to a faster resolution time for user issues.
