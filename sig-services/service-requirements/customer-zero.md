title: Have a customer zero
persona: Service developer
phase: Service development
---

**This requirement is optional**

Having customer zero allows service to get instant feedback before the public release. From customer zero, developers can gather feedback on features of their service, UX design, and others. An important part of this process is not to share any developer or maintainer knowledge about the project with customer zero. Customer should be allowed to use the service on their own but should be observed by developers and in close contact with support.

## Requirements

- Customer zero should be identified
- Customer zero should not have any developer or maintainer knowledge of the project and should be allowed to use the service on their own

## Reasoning

Identifying customer zero leads to a better testing of the service before release. Developers benefit from this testing and can find major flaws in their UX design or problems with the concepts of their service.
