title: Define and explain the security implications
persona: service provider/owner
phase: service-design, service-operational
---

The service should disclose all security implications that can have an impact on a user who subscribes to the service. These implications are listed in a document that describes in detail what is the risk and why it is necessary for the full functionality of the service. In case there's an option to opt-out of a particular risk factor the document states what effect it has on service functionality.

## Requirements

- Define and disclose all the security implications and explain why they are required in a form (a separate document or a prompt before subscription to the service) easily accessible by the user

## Reasoning

Defining and explaining the security implications can help the user with assessing the security risk associated with using the service. It boosts service transparency and rationalizes user expectations.
