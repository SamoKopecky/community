title: Code of Conduct
persona: service provider/owner
phase: service-operational

Service should contain a Code of Conduct that describes how contributors should engage with the community and what are not acceptable ways to interact with users. Examples of a good Code of Conduct can be [Django's Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/), [auth0's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/auth0/open-source-template/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) and [Contributor's Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md).

## Requirements

- Service contains a Code of Conduct that defines how to engage with the community
- Code of Conduct defines how it will be enforced
- Code of Conduct contains information on where can users send information about possible violations

## Reasoning

Creating a Code of Conduct assures new users and contributors have guidelines for interacting with other users while using the service. Creating a Code of Conduct can lead to a more accessible environment that welcomes new users.
