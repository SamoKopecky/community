A service should have clearly defined personas. Each individual persona should be well described. This includes describing their roles and responsibilities so that a person can clearly associate with one.

See an example of defined personas for metrics [here](https://github.com/operate-first/peribolos-as-a-service/blob/main/Metrics.md#personas).

## Requirements

- Define personas while following this [ADR 00002](https://github.com/operate-first/sre/blob/main/ADRs/RH/SIG-SRE/ADR-00002%20Personas%20related%20to%20Managed%20Services.md) as a recommendation

## Reasoning

Personas are created to identify and categorize people into groups so that a person can learn what their roles or responsibilities are in a defined service.
